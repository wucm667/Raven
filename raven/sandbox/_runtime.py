"""Internal helper: build a boxlite runtime rooted at raven's data dir.

Every boxlite usage inside raven (BoxliteExecutor, SandboxDebugServer)
goes through this helper so that the runtime's home_dir (DB, images, layers)
lives under <data_dir>/sandbox/boxlite rather than the boxlite default of
~/.boxlite.

The runtime is memoised per (Boxlite class, home_dir) because boxlite's Rust
core takes a process-wide filesystem lock per home_dir that is only released
when the ``Boxlite`` instance is dropped — building a fresh ``Boxlite`` on
every call would conflict with the still-alive previous instance and panic
with "Another BoxliteRuntime is already using directory: …".

The class object is part of the cache key (not just the home_dir) so that
unit tests which ``mock.patch("boxlite.Boxlite")`` get a fresh mocked runtime
on each patch instead of the cached real-Boxlite from a prior test.
