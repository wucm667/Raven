"""HubSkillSource — SkillForgeRouter source over the remote Skill Hub.

Discovery layer (Tier 0): turns ``GET /openapi/v1/skills?q=`` catalog
metadata into :class:`RouterHit` candidates for RRF fusion. The body
(``skill_md``) is NOT fetched here — that's the
:class:`SkillsSegmentBuilder`'s pre-gate body-hydrate step which calls
``SkillHubClient.get(id)`` in parallel across all Hub candidates so the
LLM gate sees real body excerpts when deciding what to inject.

Bundled file download (zip → extract → resolved refs) happens in the
post-gate hydrate, only for the 0-2 hits the gate actually selects — so
catalog calls are O(K) but downloads are O(selected).

Failures are swallowed into an empty list by the router's
``_safe_search``, so a Hub outage never poisons the whole assembly.
