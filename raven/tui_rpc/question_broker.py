"""QuestionBroker — sync↔async ask-user round-trip keyed by conversation_id.

Generalizes :class:`ConfirmBroker` for the ``ask_user`` tool. The difference is
the key: a confirm mints its own ``request_id`` and that is the only handle the
caller has, whereas an ask_user round-trip is answered by an inbound channel
message whose only handle is the conversation_id. So the pending registry is
keyed by conversation_id; an internal request_id is still minted and carried in
the notification so a frontend that prefers to answer by request_id can.

Like ConfirmBroker it is transport-agnostic: constructed with a notification
emit callable (bound to ``RpcServer.send_frame`` in production), and every
fail-safe path (timeout, cancel, internal error, connection EOF via
:meth:`cancel_all`) resolves to the prompt's ``default`` rather than raising —
the agent loop must always get a string back.
