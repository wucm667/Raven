"""Unit tests for TaskDiscoverer.min_occurrences_to_surface — the
confidence floor that prevents seen-once "routines" from popping up to
the user as confirmable suggestions.

Without the threshold, a single 2-event coincidence (e.g. user happened
to open the same app twice in a window) gets surfaced as a "routine"
the LLM may dress up as actionable. The threshold filters those out
before the discovery prompt is built."""
