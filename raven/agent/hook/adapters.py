"""Adapter hooks that wrap the legacy AgentLoop callback parameters.

These let AgentLoop keep accepting the existing
``response_modifier`` / ``on_user_inbound`` / ``decision_consumer``
constructor parameters (preserving the test surface and Sentinel
wire-up) while the internal call sites switch to a single
``CompositeHook`` chain. Each adapter is a thin shim — its only job
is to translate the legacy callable signature into a hook method.

Each adapter is intentionally restricted to a single phase. The
``name`` property tags them with ``Legacy`` so logs / debug output
distinguish them from purpose-built hooks (Sentinel, eval_engine, …).

When the legacy callback parameter is ``None`` the adapter is simply
not constructed — AgentLoop only adds adapters for non-None callbacks.

Future work (post-Phase-6): once external callers stop passing
the legacy parameters and adopt the AgentHook contract directly, these
adapters can be deleted.
