"""RPC method handler subpackage.

Each module corresponds to a domain (system / setup / reload / config /
cli_dispatch / session / terminal / stubs / …) and exposes a
``register_<domain>_methods()`` helper that the server loop calls at startup.

The umbrella :func:`register_aligned_methods` registers every handler that
the ui-tui frontend currently calls:

* ``system.*`` (3) — handshake / ping / version
* ``cli.dispatch`` (1) — in-process EC CLI runner
* ``setup.status`` (1) — provider detect
* ``reload.mcp`` (1) — hermes 5s poll no-op
* ``config.get`` / ``config.set`` (2) — hot-changeable config
* ``session.{create, close, resume}`` (3) — Wave 6.5 lifecycle return-shape
  stubs (real SessionManager wiring deferred)
* ``terminal.resize`` (1) — Wave 6.5 SIGWINCH no-op + cols record
* hermes-only stub groups (27 names after Wave 6.5): 6 original groups
  (voice / browser / spawn_tree / process.stop / rollback / tools.configure)
  + 17 Wave 6.5 unaligned method names that return -32012

Domains that are NOT yet aligned (turn.* / skill.* / model.* / mcp.*) are
deliberately omitted from the umbrella — they wait for the frontend/backend
alignment audit before being wired in.
