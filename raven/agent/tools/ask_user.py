"""ask_user tool — pause the turn to ask the user a question and await the reply.

Blocking interaction: the registry does NOT wrap this in a timeout (the
QuestionBroker manages its own fail-safe). On execute the tool hands the turn's
conversation_id and the prompt to the broker, which emits a ``clarify.request``
notification and blocks until an inbound answer arrives (or the broker's
fail-safe default fires). The returned answer is rendered as a natural-language
tool result; the loop never sees an exception.
