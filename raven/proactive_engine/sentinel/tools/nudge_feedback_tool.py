"""``nudge_feedback`` tool: lets the main LLM classify the user's
intent toward a recent Sentinel-dispatched proactive nudge.

Why this exists: a regex-only path recording any non-``/dismiss``
reply as ACCEPTED would silently inflate the topic's acceptance_rate
on natural-language dismissals like "stop reminding me" / "so annoying" — the
adaptive-quota multiplier would then push *more* nudges, not fewer.
This tool defers the call to the main LLM's semantic judgement of the
same user message at zero extra LLM cost (the LLM runs anyway).

The tool is always registered. ``SentinelRunner.consume_feedback_via_tool``
gracefully reports ``recorded=False, reason=no_awaiting_nudge`` when
the LLM calls it spuriously — so over-eager calls are harmless.

The current session is published into the
``sentinel_current_session_key`` contextvar by ``on_user_inbound``;
asyncio context propagation carries it through to ``execute()``.
