"""NudgePolicy — anti-spam gate for all three Sentinel nudge executors.

Called by NudgeDispatcher / NudgeInjector / DeferManager before dispatching a
Planner decision. Enforces quotas, quiet hours, per-session cooldown, content
dedup, and dismissal cooldown in one place.

Design:
- Optionally file-backed via JsonStateStore (when running multiple Raven
  processes, e.g. REPL + gateway together). Without a store, state is
  process-local and resets on restart.
- Deterministic via injectable ``now_fn`` — tests freeze time.
- Thread-safety: the policy is designed for a single asyncio event loop. No
  explicit locks; callers must not share a NudgePolicy instance across
  threads.
- ``check(...)`` returns a verdict only — does NOT mutate state. Executors
  must call ``record_fired(...)`` after successful dispatch so the same
  decision can't be replayed under a tighter window.

        Symmetric: multiplier is in [0.2, 1.5]. When data is insufficient
        (``dispatched_count < min_volume`` or ``acceptance_rate is None``),
        stays at the cold-start floor of 0.7× — conservative but high
        enough to bootstrap the feedback loop (lower values gate so hard
        that restraint collapses to 0/N: no fires → no feedback → no
        relaxation).

        Tiers (acceptance_rate, dispatched threshold):
        - ≥ 0.9 and ≥ ``min_volume_for_loosen`` → 1.5  (loosen; high-
          engagement user wants more proactivity)
        - ≥ 0.7 → 1.0 (neutral; no change to default budget)
        - ≥ 0.5 → 0.7 (early tightening — moderate engagement)
        - ≥ 0.3 → 0.5 (clear under-engagement)
        - <  0.3 → 0.2 (aggressive tighten — user mostly ignores/dismisses)

        ``min_volume_for_loosen`` defaults to ``2 * min_volume`` (10 at
        min_volume=5). Asymmetric: false-positive loosening (more nudges
        from a misread signal) is more user-visible than false-positive
        tightening.

        Acceptance uses EXPLICIT signals from NudgeFeedbackTracker
        (record_accepted() called when user replies / takes action), NOT
        implicit "no dismiss = accept". So ≥ 0.9 requires the user to
        actively engage with 90%+ of nudges, not just stay quiet.

        Pairs with feedback decay (NudgeFeedbackTracker.acceptance_rate
        already uses a rolling window via ``since_days``) so the rate
        reflects RECENT behavior, not all-time.
