"""L2/L3 — self-evolution e2e: channel weather conversations distil a reusable
agent skill, retrievable through the production recall path.

Several channel-style weather dialogs — each a genuine two-step tool
trajectory (``curl wttr.in`` summary, then a verify query) sharing one
verify-before-report procedure — are flushed through everos with
``is_final=True`` so the boundary fires and extraction runs
deterministically (the backend's ``store`` has no flush; that flaky
boundary-by-volume path is covered elsewhere). EverOS extracts a case per
session, clusters them, and distils a single weather skill. We then
assert that:

1. a clustered ``agent_skill`` exists, well-formed, weather-related
   (the authoritative extraction check, mirroring
   ``test_everos_extraction_real_llm``); and
2. the distilled skill is retrievable through the production
   :meth:`EverosBackend.recall` path — the same call ``EverosSkillSource``
   makes to fill the ``# Skills`` context section — returned as ``type==skill``.

Assertions are structural + keyword, never exact-string, because LLM
extraction is non-deterministic.
