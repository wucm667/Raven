"""attention.md section producers — one class per H2.

Each :class:`AttentionProducer` subclass owns one canonical H2 section
in ``user_memory/attention.md``. :class:`AttentionUpdater` orchestrates
the lot: per tick it calls ``should_run`` → ``compute_body`` for each
producer (compute is outside the lock so slow producers like LLM calls
don't block hot-path writers), then grabs the attention.md lock once
and splices all bodies in a single write.

Splitting one section = one class means:

- P4-B (stance log, currently-focused-on) and P4-C (LLM forecast +
  behavior patterns) plug in by adding new producers — no edits to
  AttentionUpdater or the existing producers.
- Cooldown / feature-flag logic lives next to the section's content
  rendering, not bolted on the orchestrator.
- Tests target one producer at a time without dragging the whole
  orchestrator into the test setup.
