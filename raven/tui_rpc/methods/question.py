"""``clarify.respond`` RPC handler — ask-user round-trip answer sink.

The frontend answers a ``clarify.request`` (emitted by :class:`QuestionBroker`
from inside a paused ask_user tool call) with
``clarify.respond {request_id, answer}``; this handler resolves the matching
pending future on the broker. ``clarify.request`` / ``clarify.respond`` is the
ui-tui frontend's existing multi-choice prompt contract (ClarifyPrompt), which
the broker reuses rather than introducing a new frontend card.

Registered via a closure that pre-binds the broker (mirrors
``register_confirm_methods``). Gated on a non-None broker by the umbrella, so
paths that build no broker do not register it.

This method is intentionally NOT in ``METHOD_MODELS`` / ``openrpc.json`` — like
the confirm pair, the question round-trip lives outside the cross-language
schema-parity contract.
