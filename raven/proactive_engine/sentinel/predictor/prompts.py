"""Discovery prompt — generates 3-4 candidate task suggestions per day.

This is intentionally separate from the reactive Planner prompt
(``raven.proactive_engine.sentinel.trigger_policy.prompts``) because the output shape is different:

- Planner answers a single ``should-I-nudge / spawn / skip`` decision.
- Discoverer produces a *list* of options the user picks from later.

We expose both shapes via JSON tool-call. Keep the prompt schematic and
short so cheap models (qwen3.5-27B) can reliably emit valid JSON.
