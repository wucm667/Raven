"""Write Eval Engine verdicts back into MemoryEngine.

Writes a one-line HISTORY.md entry per judged turn through the
MemoryEngine facade. When ``MemoryEngine`` gains a dedicated
``write_observations`` method, the adapter will switch to it; for now
``append_history`` keeps the audit trail visible
to Sentinel ContextAssembler without inventing new file types.

The adapter is intentionally a thin shim — it doesn't perform any I/O
of its own beyond the MemoryEngine call. All semantic decisions
(verdict mapping, formatting) live here so the hook stays focused on
when-to-fire logic.
