"""NudgeFeedbackTracker — record dispatched / accepted / dismissed signals.

Every Sentinel executor calls ``tracker.record_dispatched(...)`` after a
successful dispatch. When a downstream signal arrives (user replied to a
nudge, user explicitly dismissed, session eventually produced the action
the nudge suggested), the tracker records it against the original dispatch
event.

Persistence: append-only JSONL at ``{sentinel_dir}/feedback.jsonl``
(default ``~/.raven/sentinel/feedback.jsonl``). The ledger feeds
NudgePolicy's user-level acceptance-rate model, so it lives next to
``state.json`` rather than under the workspace.

Older installs that wrote to ``{workspace}/sentinel_feedback.jsonl`` are
migrated on next sentinel start by
``raven.cli._proactive_stack._migrate_legacy_feedback_log``.

Not a ring buffer: keeps every event. The file grows roughly
(#nudges/day) × (bytes/event) ≈ a few KB/day — fine for months.

        Reachability note: pure silence rarely trips L5 on its own — at 0.5
        each it takes ~6 IGNORED on one topic in 24h, usually more than that

        on L5 it mostly matters mixed with explicit dismissals (e.g. 2 dismiss
        + 2 ignored = 3.0). This is intended — silence is weak evidence.

        Atomic via temp file + rename so a crash mid-rewrite leaves the
