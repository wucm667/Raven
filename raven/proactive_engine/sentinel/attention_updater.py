"""AttentionUpdater — runs a list of ``AttentionProducer`` instances on
each Sentinel tick and writes ``user_memory/attention.md`` once under
the dedicated fcntl lock.

Two-phase execution so slow producers (LLM calls in P4-C) don't hold
the attention.md lock:

1. **Compute (outside lock)**: For each producer, call
   ``should_run(now)`` then ``compute_body(now)``. Async-friendly so
   awaitable producers can be interleaved by the event loop.
2. **Splice (under lock)**: Read attention.md once, run
   :func:`upsert_section` for every (header, body) pair, write the
   merged text back if anything changed.

Compare-and-skip: when the new merged text equals the existing on-disk
content, no write happens — useful on cold ticks where no producer's
state has changed.

Per-producer failures (``should_run`` or ``compute_body`` raising) are
logged and the section is skipped; one bad producer does NOT block
the others.
