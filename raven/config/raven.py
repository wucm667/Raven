Design:
    - ``RavenConfig`` composes the base ``Config`` rather than subclassing

    - Each feature block has its own Pydantic model. Defaults are

class CheckpointConfig(_Base):

    When active, the agent loop commits the workspace to an out-of-band

    multi-file edit leaves a recoverable snapshot, and the next turn gets a
    recovery prompt listing what the interrupted turn changed.

    Activation is gated by ``policy`` and the AgentLoop's ``interactive``
    flag (set per call site by the CLI / TUI / gateway entry points):

    - ``"always"``     — active in every AgentLoop, including ``-m``
                          one-shot commands.
    - ``"interactive"`` — active only when constructed for a multi-turn
                          session (REPL, TUI, gateway). One-shot commands
                          have no "next turn" to inject recovery into, so
                          paying the snapshot cost there is wasted.
    - ``"never"``      — disabled entirely; loop is byte-identical to the
                          pre-Bug2 baseline (no commits, no interrupt
                          reclassification, no recovery injection).

    Default ``"interactive"`` matches mature competitors (Claude Code,
    Cursor) which transparently checkpoint long sessions while leaving
    one-shot batch invocations untouched.
