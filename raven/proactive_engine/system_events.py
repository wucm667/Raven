"""Global system-event queue feeding the heartbeat wake loop.

Single-consumer (the HeartbeatService loop), single-producer-process
(everything runs inside the gateway's asyncio loop). Events are ephemeral
by design: they never persist to disk and never enter session history —
losing them on crash is acceptable because the next interval tick re-reads
the world from HEARTBEAT.md anyway.

Consumption is two-phase (``peek_all`` → tick → ``ack``) so a failed
heartbeat tick leaves the events in place for the next attempt instead of
silently dropping them.
