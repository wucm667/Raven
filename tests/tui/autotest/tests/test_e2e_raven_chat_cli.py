"""E2E: `raven chat` line-mode round-trip with real Qwen provider.

Controls-on chat path for the alt-screen ACCEPTANCE gate
(test_e2e_raven_tui_chat). If THIS test fails, chat layer is broken
regardless of TUI; if THIS passes but tui_chat fails, the bug is in the
TUI/RPC/Ink path.

Requires user has OpenRouter / Qwen provider configured locally
(per spike verification 2026-05-20 — `~/.raven/config.json`).
