"""CronService claims only jobs whose channel is in its allowed_channels.

The gateway's allowed_channels is IM-only (no "tui"), so a TUI-originated cron
job is fired by the TUI process, never claimed/forwarded by the gateway — a
TUI-set reminder always delivers to the TUI instead of racing to an IM channel.
