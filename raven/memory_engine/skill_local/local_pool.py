"""LocalPool — BM25 keyword retrieval over file-based skills.

The "local" pool covers everything that lives as a SKILL.md file on disk:

  - workspace/skills/ (user-authored)
  - packaged builtin/ (the 9 shipped skills)
  - workspace/skills/everos/ (EverOS-extracted, optional)

These pools are small (tens to a few hundred skills) and frequently edited,
so BM25 over the in-memory corpus is the right shape:
  - no embedding model loaded → starts in milliseconds
  - relevance is keyword-driven → user intent on a specific tool
    ("pdf" / "weather") matches better than dense semantic
  - re-tokenize per ``select`` is cheap at this scale

Index is built eagerly in ``__init__`` and refreshed via the public
``rebuild_index()`` — :class:`SkillService` calls it from
``invalidate_skill_cache`` so every file-watcher / evolver invalidation
flows through to the BM25 state. Steady-state ``search`` therefore
costs one query-side tokenize + one BM25 dot-product over precomputed
``doc_freqs``; the per-doc tokenize and IDF accumulation only run when
files actually changed.

A self-contained BM25Okapi implementation (no ``rank_bm25`` / ``jieba`` /
``nltk`` dependency) keeps the install footprint small. Tokenization is
regex-based, splitting on word boundaries and treating Chinese characters
as single tokens — sufficient for skill names + descriptions, which are
mostly short English domain terms.
