"""After-iteration task-completion judge hook.

Fires once per AgentLoop turn (not once per LLM iteration). Calls the
LLM judge to classify the turn as completed / failed / unknown, then
forwards the verdict to ``EvalAdapter.record_task_completion`` which
writes it to HISTORY.md through the MemoryEngine.

The hook stays pass-through (never short-circuits): an evaluator
should never interrupt the user's reply chain, only annotate it.

A note on phase mapping: AgentLoop currently fires ``after_iteration``
inside the ReAct inner loop, which would invoke this hook on every
iteration. To stay on the "once per turn" semantic the hook tracks
the last-seen ``ctx.iteration``; if a turn's iteration count resets
(new turn) it judges; otherwise it stays quiet. This is a stopgap
until AgentLoop grows a dedicated ``after_turn`` phase distinct from
``after_iteration``.
