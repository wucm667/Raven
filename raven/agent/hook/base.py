"""AgentHook ABC + AgentHookContext + HookDecision.

This abstraction wires into AgentLoop, replacing the scattered callback
fields (``response_modifier`` / ``on_user_inbound`` / ``decision_consumer`` /
``enable_personalization``). eval_engine builds three concrete hook
implementations on top.

Design choices, deliberately kept narrow for the initial cut:

1. **All phases default to no-op.** Every method on ``AgentHook``
   returns a pass-through ``HookDecision()`` unless overridden. Subclasses
   only implement the phases they care about.

2. **Async everywhere.** Even phases that look synchronous today (e.g.
   ``response_modifier`` takes ``(str, str) -> str``) become ``async``
   here so an LLM-based hook (Eval judge, personalizer classifier) can
   be added without redoing the interface. Sync callers can simply
   ``return`` immediately.

3. **Three orthogonal return modes**, all expressed via
   ``HookDecision``:

   - *pass-through* — default. Let the next hook / main loop continue.
   - *short_circuit_result* — halt the chain and the AgentLoop returns
     this value as the outbound reply (or processes it as a final
     answer, depending on the phase). Used by
     ``decision_consumer`` short-circuit and the personalizer
     "ask a clarification question" branch.
   - *modified_content* — for ``after_send``: transform the outbound
     text. Used by Sentinel's nudge_inject (append nudge to reply).

4. **HookDecision is immutable from the hook's perspective.** Hooks
   build a fresh decision each call; ``CompositeHook`` is responsible
   for chaining modifications (next hook sees the previous hook's
   transformed content via ``ctx.outbound_content``).

5. **AgentHookContext fields are populated by phase.** Not every
   attribute is meaningful in every phase — e.g. ``turn_request`` is
   set during ``before_user_inbound`` but ``None`` during
   ``before_iteration``. Callers (AgentLoop) are responsible
   for setting the relevant fields before invoking a phase. Hooks
   should not panic on ``None`` for unused fields.

    The context is mutable: callers (AgentLoop / CompositeHook) update
    fields between phases as new information becomes available (e.g.
    ``response`` is filled after the LLM returns; ``outbound_content``
    is filled before ``after_send``). Hooks may also mutate fields
    they own — but the canonical channel for "I changed the outbound
