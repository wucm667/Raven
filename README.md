# Raven

Raven is **The Self-Improving Agent Harness**, built on top of
[EverOS](https://github.com/EverMind-AI/EverOS).

Raven continuously improves the harness around an agent: tools, skills, memory,
code execution runtime, policies, and working environment. EverOS gives Raven
durable user memory, agent memory, and world knowledge across sessions, so each
run can refine how the agent acts, what it knows, and how repeatable workflows
become reusable Agent Templates and digital workers.

## Quick Install

### Linux, macOS, WSL2

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raven.evermind.ai/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (native, PowerShell)

> **Heads up:** Native Windows runs Raven without WSL. CLI, TUI, gateway, and
> tools install natively. If you would rather use WSL2, the Linux/macOS
> one-liner above works there too.

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EverMind-AI/Raven/main/install.ps1)
```

The installer handles everything: uv, Python 3.12, Node.js 22, and Raven.

After installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc    # reload shell (or: source ~/.zshrc)
raven onboard
raven
```

Raven supports OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, GitHub Copilot,
OpenAI Codex OAuth, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

If setup fails or a provider is not ready, run:

```bash
raven doctor
```

## What You Can Do in 2 Minutes

- Start a terminal-native agent with `raven` or `raven tui`.
- Run a one-shot task from your shell with `raven agent -m "..."`.
- Configure providers, sandboxing, channels, and memory with `raven onboard`.
- Browse built-in and local SkillForge skills with `raven skill list`.
- Resume, fork, export, or delete previous work with `raven sessions list`.
- Check proactive memory and scheduled nudges with `raven sentinel status`.

## Messaging Gateways

Raven currently ships 12 gateway adapters. Use `raven channels list` to see the
adapters available in your local install and `raven gateway` to run the gateway
daemon.

| Gateway | Package id | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Telegram | `telegram` | Bot-based messaging |
| Slack | `slack` | Workspace messaging |
| Discord | `discord` | Server and bot messaging |
| WhatsApp | `whatsapp` | Uses the bundled TypeScript bridge |
| Matrix | `matrix` | Matrix rooms and direct messages |
| Feishu | `feishu` | Lark/Feishu app integration |
| WeCom | `wecom` | WeCom group and app messaging |
| Mochat | `mochat` | API/socket-based messaging |
| QQ | `qq` | QQ bot integration |
| DingTalk | `dingtalk` | DingTalk stream integration |
| Email | `email` | IMAP/SMTP mailbox integration |
| WeChat | `weixin` | Personal WeChat integration |

## Why Raven

Most agent CLIs stop at "LLM + tools + loop." That works for demos, but it
breaks down when the agent becomes part of your daily environment:

- Long sessions overflow context and lose important details.
- Every turn re-sends the same system prompt, skills, and tool definitions.
- The agent waits passively even when it can see something that needs action.
- Useful workflows stay trapped in chat history instead of becoming reusable
  skills.

Raven treats those problems as the product, not edge cases.

Raven is built around three product bets:

- **Memory-first:** user memory, agent memory, and world knowledge stay
  separate, durable, and reusable across sessions.
- **Self-improving skills:** repeated workflows can become skills, collect
  feedback, and evolve instead of staying buried in chat history.
- **Agent Templates:** builders can start from Raven, define an agent for a
  scenario, and share it without rebuilding the operating layer.

## What Raven Is Built For

Raven is designed for the workflows where ordinary chat agents feel too small.

### 1. Terminal-Native Daily Work

Raven can run as a native TUI, a direct CLI agent, or a gateway-backed agent.
The TUI is not a web shell: it is a React/Ink application talking to Raven's
Python runtime through a typed RPC protocol.

### 2. Memory That Becomes Useful

Raven connects to EverOS for long-term user and agent memory. Sessions,
procedures, and reusable patterns can be turned into local skill material
instead of disappearing into old transcripts.

### 3. Context That Does Not Collapse Under Pressure

The context stack has a legacy path and a Curator path. Under pressure, Raven
can archive, retrieve, and assemble context with explicit budgets instead of
blindly clipping the oldest messages.

### 4. Agents That Can Reach Out First

Sentinel watches events, schedules checks, evaluates whether a nudge is useful,
and routes proactive actions through guardrails. The point is not noisy
notifications; the point is an agent that can notice.

### 5. Skills That Improve

SkillForge treats skills as procedural memory. It can detect reusable workflows,
write skill files, track execution feedback, and evolve instructions when they
stop working.

## Agent Templates

Raven is an Apache-2.0 licensed, memory-first agent library built by EverMind.
It provides the runtime, memory layer, tools, and Agent Templates for building
custom agents and digital workers.

Use an Agent Template when you want Raven's operating layer but your own
scenario, personality, workflow policy, skills, integrations, or distribution
model. A template can start as one person's agent and later become a repeatable
digital worker for a team or community.

Agents, templates, skills, workflows, and modules created with Raven belong to
their creators. Builders may use, modify, commercialize, and share agents built
with Raven or based on Raven Agent Templates under the Apache-2.0 license.

We encourage builders to say "Built with Raven" and link back to this
repository. The Raven and EverMind names and logos may not be used to imply
official endorsement unless explicitly approved by EverMind.

## Architecture

Every turn flows through the Spine: one entry (`submit`), one exit (`emit`),
and per-conversation lanes for ordering and cancellation. Feature engines plug
into the agent loop through explicit handoffs instead of importing each other.

```text
Channels / TUI / Gateway
        |
        v
   Raven Spine
 submit -> lanes -> emit
        |
        v
   Agent Loop
 tools · skills · providers
        |
        +--> Context Engine   legacy / curator
        +--> Memory Engine    EverOS / local skills / SkillForge
        +--> Proactive Engine Sentinel / scheduler / nudge policy
        +--> TokenWise        usage tracking / cache placement / routing
        +--> Eval Engine      task judgement and coordination
```

## Developer Workflow

Install everything and set up hooks:

```bash
make install
```

Run the local CI gate:

```bash
make ci
```

Focused commands:

```bash
make lint-python
make lint-tui
make lint-bridge
make test-python
make test-tui
```

The repository uses:

- `uv` for Python dependency management;
- `ruff` and `pre-commit` for Python and repository hygiene;
- `commitlint` plus a Python checker for Conventional Commit subjects and
  ASCII-only public history;
- `eslint`, `tsc`, `vitest`, and RPC drift checks for the TUI;
- `npm ci`, `tsc`, and `npm audit --audit-level=critical` for the bridge.

`CLAUDE.md` contains the full collaboration rules for branch naming, commit
format, dependency updates, testing, and PR hygiene.

## Star Us

If Raven is the kind of command line agent you want to exist, star the repo.
It helps more terminal-native builders discover the project and gives the
EverMind ecosystem a stronger signal to keep investing in open agents.
