    spine ``submit`` as a CRON-origin turn.

    ``submit`` (required) is the spine entry (build_gateway / build_repl /
    build_tui scheduler). A single-target delivering job (deliver=True, the
    user-facing reminder the cron tool creates) rides the hub to its one outlet.
    A broadcast (more than one resolved target) or a silent job (deliver=False)
    submits with the job's own (ephemeral) channel as the source so the hub drops
    the reply; a broadcast is then delivered explicitly to every target, a silent
    job delivers nothing.

    ``readback_texts`` is build_gateway's per-conversation reply-text map, the
    spine read-back channel for the system event: a CRON turn submits, then this
    reads back its reply from ``readback_texts[cron:<job_id>]`` (the runner stored
    it before result() resolved) and pops it. The submitter cannot pass run_turn's
    text_sink itself — text_sink is a runner-set per-call param, and cron is a
    submitter — so the gateway's capturing runner bridges it. Required whenever
    ``submit`` is wired; without it the system event sees no reply text.

    ``default_channel`` is used when the job payload doesn't specify one —
    REPL passes "cli" so the reminder renders inline in the terminal; the
    gateway lets the payload's own channel decide.

    ``channel_manager`` / ``session_manager`` drive delivery resolution
    (``resolve_cron_delivery``). Without ``channel_manager`` the enabled
    set is empty — meaning every channel is considered ephemeral, and
    delivery falls back to forward_channels broadcast. REPL paths that
    have no real channels (agent-only mode) pass ``None`` for both and
    accept that ephemeral reminders are dropped with a warning.

    ``sentinel_runner`` is optional. When present, F-G makes cron fires
    write to the shared NudgePolicy ledger (topic_fired_at +
    record_dispatched) so the L3 Sentinel suppresses its own proactive
    nudges on the same topic within the dedup window. Without this,
    Sentinel and Cron are blind to each other and the user gets double-
    nudged on the same subject (e.g. user-asked "5/25 birthday cron"
    fires AND Sentinel proactively reminds at 5/22).

    ``system_events`` / ``wake`` are optional. When wired (gateway path),
    each completed or failed cron run enqueues a system event and requests
    an early heartbeat tick, so the main heartbeat session learns what
    happened in the isolated ``cron:<job_id>`` session and can decide on
    follow-ups.
    Only effective for jobs executed in this process — a CLI test-fire
    runs in its own process and cannot reach the gateway's queue.
