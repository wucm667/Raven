"""Cron tool for scheduling reminders and tasks.

Two layers live here:

1. ``CronTool`` — the LLM-facing agent tool. Creates jobs with the
   request-time channel/chat_id verbatim; no forwarding decision here.
2. ``resolve_cron_delivery`` — delivery resolver consumed at TRIGGER
   time by ``raven.cli._cron_handler``. Pass-through for real
