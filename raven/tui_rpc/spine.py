"""Spine wiring for the TUI RPC turn path: the runner (a TuiTurnRunner driving
the agent loop's native run_turn with stream=True), the outlet that maps each
spine event to its wire event (token.delta / thinking.delta / tool.*), and the
sink that fires ``message.complete`` / ``error`` after the render barrier.

The TUI runs turns through spine (submit -> lane -> run_turn -> hub -> outlet).
All of token/reasoning/tool/Text flow through the hub to the TuiOutlet, so they
share one per-outlet FIFO. spine never imports tui_rpc; tui_rpc imports spine.

Why ``message.complete`` is fired from the sink (not from a stream-close): it is
an unconditional per-turn signal — the front-end clears its turn slot on it, so a
turn that streams nothing (empty reply, tool-only) must still emit it or the UI
wedges. The sink awaits ``wait_idle`` first so it lands after the turn's last
``token.delta``; an empty turn never built a queue, so the barrier returns at
once. This is the REPL's ``result() -> wait_idle`` render barrier moved into the
sink.
