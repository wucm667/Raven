"""Regression guard: TUI must not let third-party named
loggers write to the terminal stderr inherited by Ink.

LiteLLM (and similar libs) install their own ``<StreamHandler <stderr>>`` on
named loggers (``LiteLLM`` / ``LiteLLM Router`` / ``LiteLLM Proxy``) at import
time. The InterceptHandler installed at the root logger by
``redirect_loguru_to_file`` does NOT catch records that the named-logger's own
handler emits — the handler fires before the propagation step. So per-chunk
``verbose_logger.debug("model_response.choices[0].delta: ...")`` (litellm
``streaming_handler.py``) writes to ``sys.stderr`` per token, which under the
TUI's inherited-TTY model overlays the Ink alt-screen render.

``redirect_loguru_to_file`` must therefore explicitly strip stderr/stdout
StreamHandlers from named loggers when it sets up TUI logging.
